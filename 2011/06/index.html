                        ImageShare was designed for optimal performance in Google Chrome. But whether you’re using Internet Explorer 
                        (IE) because you prefer that browser or because your Internet service prevents you from getting Chrome, there’s a way to not 
                        only get the best ImageShare experience, but also get faster Internet browsing in general!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/chrome-frame/?csw=1">Google Chrome Frame</a> is an Open Source plugin that allows you to execute 
                        Chrome-like features on IE. Using the Frame, you can enable access to sites using HTML5 and other technology that may not be supported by your 
                        current browser. The enhanced JavaScript will boost performance and help make your applications run faster. This all happens seamlessly since 
                        Frame shares the network, cache, and cookies with your open IE so your log-ins will be preserved and all your open sites will stay as they are. 
                        You are in control of when it operates since it only starts when you tell it to, and it’s easy to opt in and out. Although it may take a few seconds 
                        longer to initiate, speed tests have shown that it loads pages noticeably faster after the initial load-up. For example, Gmail on Google Chrome Frame
                        runs 30% faster.
                    </p>

                        Utilizing Frame will also enable smoother execution of ImageShare. Though most features work equally well on browsers such as IE and Firefox, the Chrome 
                        engine decreases the chance of running into bugs and allows for a friendlier interface. Physicians have noted that downloads, for instance, tend to be 
                        easier to work with when they show up in Chrome on the tab at the bottom of the screen rather than in separate. The feature that will show the most significant 
                        boost is our Viewer interface. Since it runs on its special JavaScript coding, having a more powerful engine like Chrome will allow users to run through the 
                        images with greater ease and fluidity. Our unique canvas function also operates more effectively on the technology supported by Chrome since it relies on 
                        relatively more advanced scripts that IE may not no longer be able to keep up with at this point.

                        Our mission has always been to bring the best service to physicians so patients can have the best care. That is why we are suggesting this software 
                        for consideration to our users. With a simple adjustment of an Internet plug-in, doctors can achieve a better interface to evaluate their medical files. 
                        And when the physicians have a good experience, we have a good day.
