            <div>
                At Vigilant Medical, our mission is to improve patient care, save physicians' time, and
                lower overall healthcare costs. Our core values are

            </div>
            <div>
                Our story: Armed with our core set of values, we began to speak with as many physicians,
                specialists, and surgeons as we could. After consulting with some of the leading
                specialists in neurology and interventional cardiology, we began developing our
                flagship product ImageShare.

                From there our journey has revolved around working with cutomers and clinical leaders
                to develop applications that truly fit the specific needs of the organizations.
                This geedback has left us with a robust suite of add-ons and modifications that
                we can apply to quickly provide the right solutions to most image transfer problems.
                We'd love to hear your story, for we believe healthcare innovation is a constantly
                evolving process.
