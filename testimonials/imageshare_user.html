                    Users receive second opinions frequently from an undefined number of senders and therefore need an image exchange service that is different from
                    one that serves a radiology-focused user. Cardiology and Radiology workflows are fundamentally different and require fundamentally different services 
                    to meet each of their respective needs.  We offer a complete service offering and business model that reflects the way specialized practices receive 
                    second opinions and transfers. Building an open network requires hands-on training and immediately available top level support.

                <p>
                    Below is a breakdown of our user demographics. Clearly, our users follow the second opinion model of exchanging images and we’ve built 
                    our product and support infrastructure to meet the needs of an open network.
